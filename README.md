# Tutorial (If the game worked)

Hey there! Welcome to your farm.

Your farm will automatically grow, harvest, and sell your crops.

This earns you money, which you can use to buy more items.

As you can see, there are nine sections. Nine sections make a chunk.

Only one thing can take up a section at a time. Some items may take up multiple sections.

You can click the arrows to change which chunk you are looking at.

To get started, buy something from the shop.

Now place it down on a section by clicking a section with the item in your inventory selected.

If you want to change where something is, right click it to pick it up.

Use the arrow keys to change what you've selected in your inventory.

Certain items when placed down will effect how good your farm is.

You can look at your info screen to check your farms stats.

Click save to download a file that contains all your farms stats.

If you play the game again, you can load the file to keep playing.

That's all! Enjoy!
